I made a branch with some changes to the shared examples to demonstrate the problem I saw here: https://github.com/tdaffin/conrod/tree/list_crop_bug

You can then run the example for multiple backends.  Originally I saw the same problem for both the gfx and piston backends, but not for glium or vulkano.

Run it for gfx using:
`cargo run --example all_winit_gfx`

I've also made a branch that merges the fix into the shared example branch: https://github.com/tdaffin/conrod/tree/fix_list_crop_bug

cargo run --example all_winit_gfx
    see problem, not fixed by change
    
cargo run --example all_piston_window
    same problem, fixed by change
    
cargo run --example all_winit_vulkano
    works ok both with and without fix
    
cargo run --example all_winit_glium
    works ok both with and without fix
